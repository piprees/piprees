# Hi, I'm Pip- a software engineer & product designer based in Wales who loves designing, building, and optimising digital experiences.

I work well within innovative startups who have an all hands on deck approach, or well established teams looking for a leader who understands how to bridge the gap between great product design and successful development. I prefer to work remote async, but appreciate a hybrid approach can be a lot of fun too.
